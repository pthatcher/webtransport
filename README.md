# WebTransport

API that allows web applications to establish interactive, bidirectional, multiplexed network connections

It fills gaps in the web platform:
- Lack of UDP-like networking API
- Lack of WebSocket-like API without head-of-line blocking

It provides:
- Reliable streams 
- Unreliable datagrams
- Encryption and congestion control
- An origin-based security model
- Bindings for QUIC
- Multiplexing with existing HTTP/3 connections
- Flexible API that can be extended to other protocols, such as TCP fallback and p2p
- Ability to change transport without changing application code

It's great for:
- sending or receiving high-frequency, small messages that don't need to be reliable (like game state)
- sending or receiving low-latency media
- transferring files

See the [proposed spec](https://wicg.github.io/web-transport/).
